            <h3>About Shapes</h3>

            <p>The Shapes is a simple JavaScript application, which offers to users
              a drawing functionality.
            </p>
            <h5>A short user guide</h5>
            <h6>Workspace</h6>

            <p>Application contains three main sections:
              <ul>
                <li>Header</li>
                <li>Working area</li>
                <li>Footer</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Header contains the name of the app, and the reset button on the right. Working
              area show the drawing space and basic information about the points, parallelogram
              and circle.</p>
            <h6>Usage</h6>

            <p>By using the Shapes application, user is able to create parallelogram and circle
              only by choosing three points on the Working area. When application is started
              the working area is empty. User can place points by clicking on the working area.
              If the point is wrongly placed, user is still able to drag point to different position. After third point
              is placed on the screen, a parallelogram and circle is created. Circle is placed to the center
              of parallelogram and has same area as parallelogram. If one wants to start over, there is reset button.
              After shapes are created, it is still possible to rearrange the three points, circle and parallelogram is
              updated accordingly.</p>
